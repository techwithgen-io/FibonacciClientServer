## 🔗 Projects Overview

### 🖥️ Server (`/FibonacciServer`)
- Listens on port `5000`
- Accepts a number from the client
- Computes the Fibonacci number using dynamic programming
- Sends the result back to the client

### 💻 Client (`/FibonacciClient`)
- Java Swing GUI
- User enters a number
- Connects to the server via socket
- Displays the Fibonacci number returned from the server
- Handles input errors gracefully

## 🛠 Requirements

- Java 8+
- Any IDE (NetBeans, IntelliJ, Eclipse) or command line
